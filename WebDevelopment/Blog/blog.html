        <h3>Gallvinating around the Balkans</h3>
       
        <h4>Posted on 22/09/2016</h4>
      
        <p>This post will be about my recent trip to Europe. We went to several places including London to catch up with friends, Dubrovnik and Split in Croatia, Sarajevo and Mostar in Bosnia, Kotor in Montenegro and Ljubljana in Slovenia. While the weather was a bit cloudy and rainy in London, it was much better in the Balkan countries with hot sunny dry weather everyday.</p>

        <p>Most days were spent wandering around the town or city on foot, stopping for food or a beer as we felt like it. Our favourite food was probably the pizza we had in Sarajevo, and favourite was fig liquer we bought in Croatia. Other activities we did included visiting the gigantic caves in Skojan, which took 3 hours to walk through on a guided tour. The photo above was taken of a part of the cave that had collapsed thousands of years ago, and really does not do the size of the caves justice.</p>

        <p>We also went swimming at a couple of places along the coast of Croatia. This area is extremely popular with tourists so it is pretty busy everywhere but the coastline is still very beautiful so it's not hard to see why it is so popular. We also did a couple of short hikes up to old hill top forts which were hard work in the heat but worth it for the amazing views from the top.</p>

        <p>Our favourite country was Bosnia. There are still unexploded landmines in Bosnia from the war that ended in 1996. Sarajevo is a very cosmopolitian city with lots of bars and restaurants, and Mostar is a smaller town with a very picturesque old bridge (Stari Most). This bridge was destroyed in the war but has since been rebuilt. Apart from this bridge, the rest of Bosnia seemed a lot less touristy than Croatia so it felt a lot more "local".</p>

        <p>Overall it was an awesome trip. As nearly all of my previous travelling has been done solo, I thought it might be a little weird to travel with my boyfriend but after a couple of days I really started to enjoy having company while travelling, and it will be a lot harder to go back to travelling on my own. I'm not sure where my/our next trip will be to but I would definitely not complain if we head back to the Balkans.</p>
